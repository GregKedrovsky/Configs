The shebang (SHarp bang):

    #! /bin/sh

Put the shebang at the left margin of the first line of your shell scripts. Blanks after ! are OK (optional but not necessary).  Use a complete pathname (no search is done). At the moment the whole line is restricted to 16 characters but this limit will be raised.
